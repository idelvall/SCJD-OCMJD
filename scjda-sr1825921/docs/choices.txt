# Overview:
-----------
    This file describes the significant design choices I made, details the problems and uncertainties I perceived, the 
    issues surrounding them, and the decisions I made when resolving them.
   
    
# General Considerations:
-------------------------
    The following principles have been applied whenever was possible overall the project:

        - SoC (Separation of Concerns) Principle:
            Identify independent functionality and model it as independent abstractions, maximizing components cohesion. 
            Each type has a specific and predefined purpose and responsibility.
            Example: 
                Data functionality is split into three independent concerns: 
                data access functionality, locking, search algorithms. 

    	- Dependency inversion principle (DIP) Depend upon interfaces, in order to make the components the most reusable
    	   generic, and pluggable as possible. All main components in the application are designed implementing the most 
    	   generic interface that defines its main purpose. All required functionality is declared by references to 
    	   those interfaces.
    	        
    	- Usage of standard design patterns.
    	
    	- Enforce encapsulation:
        	- Reduce member visibility whenever is possible.
        	- Classes not designed to be extended are declared final.
        	- Attributes not designed to change are declared final.
        	
        - Abstraction Principle: Do not repeat code. Extract common functionality to superclasses or helper classes.
	
	
# Architecture description:
---------------------------    
    Chosen architecture is a 2 tier solution, that is, a client-server architecture with server exposing data access 
    services. In the "Uncertainties found" section is explained why.  
    
    Data Access Layer: 
    ------------------
        1) Purpose: implement DBAccess services.
        2) Base package: suncertify.db
        3) Depends on packages: 
        4) Main resources:
            - Outer interface: DBAccess (implemented by Data class)
            - Data class uses
                DataAccessObject (implemented by URLyBirdFile_1_2_1) CRUD data operations to the data file.
                LockManager (implemented by DefaultLockManagerImpl) Logical locking.
                FinderObject (implemented by DefaultFinderImp) FindByCriteria algorithms.
        
    RMI server: 
    -----------
        1) Purpose: Make DAL accessible remotely.
        2) Base package: suncertify.server
        3) Depends on packages: suncertify.db
        4) Main resources:
            - Server class: start/stop operations.
                Start: Creates a RemoteDBAccessFactory instance and publishes it to the RMI registry;
                Stop: Performs a clean shutdown: unbinds the factory from the registry, makes it to reject incoming 
                calls, waits a short period before interrupt pending threads.
            - Published Remote interface RemoteDBAccessFactory (implemented by RemoteDBAccessFactoryImpl): Single 
                instance bounded to the RMI registry.
            - RemoteDBAccess (implemented by RemoteData), created and RMI exported by the factory, one for each client. 
                All of them share the same DBAccess instance.
	
	RMI Client: 
	-----------
        1) Purpose: Providing a DBAccess proxy, isolating the client from underlying server implementation.
        2) Base package: suncertify.client
        3) Depends on packages: suncertify.server, suncertify.db
        4) Main resources:
            - Client class: Provides an static factory method to create DBAccess instances: connect(String host, int 
                port). Gets the RMI registry from the specified parameters, gets the factory bound by the server, 
                creates new RemoteDBAccess with the factory and adapts it to the DBAccess interface with the next class:  
            - RemoteDataAdapter class: DBAccess implementation returned by previous method call. This class implements 
                DBAccess wrapping a RemoteDBAccess. Delegates to the wrapped instance all method calls and transforms 
                the RMI checked exceptions in unchecked.
	
	Business Logic Layer:
	---------------------
        1) Purpose: Isolating the client from the data layer functionality and offer a higher level of abstraction 
            closer to the real life modeled business.
        2) Base package: suncertify.bs
        3) Depends on packages: suncertify.db
        4) Main resources:
            HotelRoom class: Business object.
            suncertify.bs.commands package: Several business commands.
            
	Presentation Layer:
	-------------------
        1) Purpose: Letting the users interact with the applications.
        2) Base package: suncertify.gui
        3) Server PL depends on packages: suncertify.server, suncertify.db
           Client PL depends on packages: suncertify.client, suncertify.bs, suncertify.db
        4) Main resources:
            Server:
                - ServerGUI class: Lets the server administrator manage a Server class instance.
            Client:
                - ClientGUI class: Lets the CSR's connect to a local database or remote server and executes business 
                    commands
                - suncertify.gui.client package: command invocation and notification framework. 


# Data implementation:
----------------------
    Data functionality is split in three independent concerns: Locking, CRUD operations and findByCriteria algorithm. 
    Each one is represented by one interface: LockManager, DataAccessObject and FinderObject respectively.
    Data instance wraps a delegate for each one of the previous interfaces. 
    Locking will be explained in a dedicated paragraph. 
    
    DataAccessObject: 
    -----------------
        Provides a unified interface to a persistent mechanism, isolating the client from the storage nature.
        Makes easier a possible migration to a relational database solution.
       
        Implementation: URLyBirdFile_1_2_1 class.
           This class provides CRUD services to a 1.2.1 compatible data file. It is based on a RandomAccessFile, using 
           the record number as record identifier. All public methods of this class are synchronized as RandomAccessFile
           is not thread-safe (file pointer is an instance state).
      
        Improvements: Create a new DataAccessObject implementation for cache the database in memory reducing file 
            access. It would act as a proxy of another wrapped DataAccessObject, delegating and synchronizing its state 
            when necessary. Given the URLyBird background (a temporary solution), an static cache of all database 
            records should be acceptable.
            
    FinderObject:
    -------------
        Based on requirement ".. data access system that provides ... flexible search mechanism", searching 
        functionality is represented by its own abstraction. "Flexible" here has been interpreted as "able to change".
        
        Implementation: DefaultFinderImp class (uses a DataAccessObject instance). Its performance could be highly 
        improved using a DataAccessObject cache as stated in the previous paragraph. 
     
    SecurityException:
    ------------------         
        A custom SecurityException has been created since java.lang.SecurityException documentation says:
        "Thrown by the security manager to indicate a security violation." and security exceptions in our application
        are not thrown by the security manager.
         
# Server:
---------
    Choose RMI over sockets:
    ------------------------
        RMI benefits:
            1) RMI solution is faster and easier to implement, once some basic understanding of the technology is 
                achieved. 
            2) RMI offers a mature standard solution. A socket based solution would have to implement from scratch 
                many functionality that is already provided by the RMI runtime. So RMI election is less prone to errors.
            3) RMI solution is more maintainable (since it is a standard technology). 
            4) RMI solution is more extensible (provides lots of characteristics ready to use: SSL, dynamic code 
                download, support non java clients (IIOP protocol) and facilitate its proxy creation via IDL, without 
                needing to know a custom protocol).
            5) RMI solution is more manageable since can be parametrized externally via VM arguments.
            6) RMI provides network transparency (remote objects behave like local ones) and compile-time type safety, 
                so code is more robust.
            7) Future migration to an enterprise solution (based in EJBs) is much simpler.  
            
        Socket benefits:
            1) Socket solution can outperform RMI solution, since we have total control of the messages being sent. 
            2) Socket solution is easier to understand for a junior programmer since socket API is much simpler than the
                hole RMI runtime. 
           
        Decision: 
            I chose RMI because performance is not a design consideration for the assignment. 
            Despite of being harder to understand, it is preferred because of code simplicity, prone to errors lower
            level, and being a standard technology. 
    
    Server having a GUI:
    --------------------
        Based on the requirement: "Your programs MUST not require use of command line property specifications, All 
        configuration MUST be done via a GUI"
        Improvements: 
            - Don't be GUI based, support headless systems:
                Create a main class to start the server with the parameters specified via command line, and create 
                another main class to stop the server. This way, the server can be started and stopped by executing a 
                script. Communication between both processes can be done via sockets or temporary files. 
            
    Server architecture:
    --------------------
        Based on a RMI factory for two reasons:
            - Being able to detect client disconnections
            - Improve extension capabilities since client identification is possible.
            
        A RemoteDBAccessFactory implementation is bound to the registry.
        Clients use the factory to create instances of RemoteDBAcess (implementing Unreferenced interface), also a 
        remote object. This instances are only remotely referenced by this client.
        Factory maintains an inner collection of created instances, to manage their life cycle, but this references are 
        local and do not affect the unreferenced notification of the instances. Created active instances are referred
        as "managed instances" in the API.
        
        RemoteDBAccessFactory implementation: RemoteDBAccessFactoryImpl: 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
            Messages factory -> managed instance:
                - export to JRMP (in creation) to make them remotely callable.
                - remoteData.setRejectCalls(true). When rejectIncomingCalls() is called in the factory, the message is 
                    passed to all managed instances. This method is called in server shutdown. After that, all calls to 
                    any remote method throw an IllegalStateException.
                - remoteData.getPendingThreads(). In factory.interruptPendingThreads() all managed instances pending 
                    threads are interrupted. Called in server shutdown.
                
            Messages managed instance -> factory: (via listener decoupling)
                - listener.notifyUnreference(this). Used to remove the instance from the managed instances list.
                    
              - Server class: start/stop operations.
                    Start: Creates a RemoteDBAccessFactory instance and publishes it to the RMI registry;
                    Stop: Performs a clean shutdown: unbinds the factory from the registry, makes it to reject incoming 
                        calls, waits a short period before interrupt pending threads.
                - Published Remote interface RemoteDBAccessFactory (implemented by RemoteDBAccessFactoryImpl): Single 
                    instance bounded to the RMI registry
                - RemoteDBAccess (implemented by RemoteData), created and RMI exported by the factory, one for each 
                    client. All of them share the same DBAccess instance.
    
        RemoteDBAcess implementation: RemoteData:
        -----------------------------------------
            - One instance for each client. ("Client" means remote reference, since a "physical" client can call create 
                several remote instances using the factory. Client proxy could be designed as singleton, but there is no
                need to limit the number of remote objects referenced by a client, since in server side, all of them are
                seen as different clients).
            - Implements Unreferenced: unreferenced() callback method to be notified of client disconnection (called by
                the RMI runtime).
                Mainly used for unlocking records locked by this user. Orphan lock avoiding.
            - All the instances use the same local DBAccess instance, that is thread safe. And delegate the calls to it. 
            
        Server shutdown:
        ----------------
            On server shutdown the following occurs:
                - The remote factory is unbound from the RMI registry.
                - Remote factory is requested to reject incoming calls (forwarding to its managed instances as seen 
                    before). At this point, no more remote calls can be made to the factory or managed instances.
                - A thread sleeps for a short interval of time (Server.GRACE_SHUTDOWN_PERIOD) to give a chance to the
                    current executing threads to end by themselves.
                - Remote factory is requested to interrupt all managed instances executing threads. 
                
        Client disconnection detection:
        -------------------------------
             - When a client disconnects, it looses its remote reference to one of the managed instances. 
             - RMI runtime calls the instance unreferenced() method after an expiration period (defined by the system 
                property java.rmi.dgc.leaseValue, in ms)
             - The managed instance then performs some resource cleaning (for example releasing the locks held by its 
                client)
             - The managed instance then notifies its state to its listeners.
             - The factory, as a listener, then removes the instance from its managed instance list and requests the GC 
                to work. 
       
        Ports allocated:
        ----------------
            - Server is designed to allocate only one port in the host machine, since the registry, the factory, and the
                managed instances are exported to the same port. This makes infrastructure administration much easier 
                (firewalls, routers, etc...)    

# Locking system:
-----------------
    Locking architecture:
    ---------------------
        Locking functionality has been modeled as an independent concern (see LockManager API).
        
        LockManagers manage a keyed collection (Map) of locking entities, so their modeling can be isolated 
        from any database resource.
        
        BaseLockManagerImpl is the base class for concrete implementations. Uses the standard java.util.concurrent.locks
        package in order to have lock fairness and a more object-oriented code style. (see BaseLockManagerImpl source
        for more details)            

    Orphan locks:
    -------------
        Orphan locks can happen in my application if a client crashes holding a room lock.
        Server orphan locks liberation is based on the RMI runtime unreferenced notification, used to identify client
        crashes.        
        Discarded alternatives:
            - Locking timeouts. Discarded because maybe is not the expected behaviour to other applications using our 
                data server.
    
    Deadlock prevention:
    --------------------
        Deadlock is the situation that would occur by having two threads waiting on lock conditions, each of them
        being the holder of the lock that serves to notify the other. In this circumstance both remain waiting 
        indefinitely.
        
        Scenarios:
            1) If an external application uses our Server to access the database, deadlock situations may occur in case 
               of trying to acquire several locks in the same client thread.
            2) In the assignment application there are no possibilities of deadlock since the previous situation is 
                avoided.
        
        Decision taken: 
            Taking into account the scenario 2, and the complexity of deadlock-prevention solution, I decided not to 
            implement it. 
        
        Proposed solution to avoid deadlock:
                
            Principles to be followed:                        
                1 - Data class interface must remain the same.
                2 - Deadlock should be avoided in both scenarios:
                     - Local environment (several threads using Data) 
                     - Distributed environment provided by the RMI server implemented (multiple threads invoking the 
                        same instance of RemoteData)
                3 - LockManager implementations should not have dependencies outside base package suncertify.db or 
                    utility package suncertify.commons
                4 - Deadlock prevention algorithm should be easily changed.
            
            Implementation:
            
                Point 1 suggest the usage of static ThreadLocal variables to access information needed
                Point 2 and 3 lead to a common abstraction to both scenarios: ClientThreadId class with two main final 
                    attributes: clientID (identifying the client), and threadId (identifying the client thread). 
                    In local environment clientID will be always the same, a predefined constant. This class would be 
                    generic enough to be located in suncertify.commons package. A ClientThreadIdProvider 
                    (getCurrentClientThreadId()) instance could be passed to LockManager implementations.
                
                In a local environment: ClientThreadIdProvider would return ClientThreadId instance. The getThreadId()  
                method of the latter would return the current executing thread identification (see "How to stateless 
                identify a local Thread"), and getClientId() would be a constant identifying the a VM local client.              
                
                In a server environment:
                    The server would identify the remote client and remote thread,  and store the information in some 
                    static Threadlocal variables.
                    Then a different ClientThreadIdProvider instance would be passed to the LockManager, making use of 
                    that static thread-scoped information.  
                
                Point 4: Could be easily implemented by a template method in the LockManager base implementation. Any 
                algorithm to use (prevent from holding two locks in the same client thread, let an ascendent locking 
                order in order to avoid cycles in the same client thread, ...) now would have available all the 
                information it needs.
            
            Problems:
                1 - How to identify a local Thread in a stateless environment (is easy to know if a thread is the same 
                    as other by the == operator, but we need base the comparison on a Serializable ID):
                    None of the thread methods guarantee a way to identify a thread. From Java API javadoc:
                    Thread.getID(): 
                        "When a thread is terminated, this thread ID May Be reused."
                    Thread.hashCode() (from Object): 
                        "As much as is Reasonably Practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return 
                        distinct integers for distinct objects. (This is Typically Implemented by converting the 
                        internal address of the object Into an integer, but this technique is Not Implementation 
                        required by the JavaTM programming language.)"
                2 - How identify a client in our server.
                3 - How identify a client thread in our server.
                
             Workarounds: 
                1 - Create a new class ThreadId with static method getId(), and with a inner static threadlocal field to
                    hold ids. This field initialization can be made from a static counter. This way each thread invoking 
                    ThreadId.getId() will be assigned a unique long incremental number of which behaviour is controlled 
                    by us. Despite of knowing that JVM sun implementation also creates thread ids sequentially, there is 
                    nothing in the Thread API that ensure this behaviour. So now we can be sure.                    
                2 - Current usage of a RMI factory makes this point straightforward. The factory has to number the 
                    RemoteData managed instances on creation.
                3 - RemoteDBAccess should add a new parameter to all its methods: long threadId. Threads will be 
                    identified in the client like explained in (1) (inside RemoteDataAdapter class), and passed to the 
                    RemoteData object. In the server, RemoteData class would move this information to a static 
                    thread-scoped variable (as explained before) and then perform the delegation to the wrapped DBAccess
                    instance as usually.  
                     
                     
# Command invocation and notification framework:
------------------------------------------------  
    This framework responds to the requirement: "Your user interface should be designed with the expectation of future 
    functionality enhancements, and it should establish a framework that will support this with minimal disruption to 
    the users when this occurs."
    
    The framework makes easy to add new business operations and new graphical components with minimal side-effects in 
    the current application code. The following are the main components in the framework:
    
    - Business commands (BusinessCommand<?> class): Based on Command and Template patterns. Encapsulates business method
        calls in objects.
        
    - GUIBeans: Graphical components to be developed must extend the base GUIBean class. On of the requirements for the
        subclasses is implement business command listener methods, so the components are able to respond to business 
        operation executions.
        
    - Mediator: Executes BusinessCommand instances and notifies the result to all the GUIBeans registered. Both 
        synchronous and asynchronous executions are supported (the latter is provided for future functionality 
        enhancements, so is not currently used). Events fired to the listener are executed in the AWT event dispatch 
        thread, making the listeners transparent to the kind of execution.
       
        Asynchronous support is provided as a base example for future functionality, and should be extended for a real 
        life application in the following ways:
            - Providing a task manager, so parallel task could be aborted, being able to show its state and estimated 
                time to complete. 
            - Providing task groups so parallel task could be executed sequentially in logical queues.
            
                    
     What to do in case of adding a new business operation:
        Create the Business command for the new operation and execute it with the client GUI Mediator instance.
        Override the needed listeners methods of those GUIBeans wanted to respond the new command.  
        
     What to do in case of adding a new graphical component:
        Extend GUIBean class and implement listener methods to attend to the desired business commands (via instanceof 
        operator). If the GUI needs to perform business operations by itself, use the protected-instance-field mediator 
        to execute the command.
      
        
# Property file management:
---------------------------  
    A simple framework has been created to fulfill the requirement: "Such configuration information MUST be stored in a 
    file called suncertify.properties which MUST be located in the current working directory".
    
    The framework (see PropertiesManager documentation) makes a class able to override its public static non final 
    fields (only certain field types are supported) from the values stored in the properties file, and able to store the
    current field values to the file.
    
    In the application, the framework is used by client and server GUIs, overriding the values at class loading time 
    (static block).
    Value storing occurs automatically at shutdown (a shutdown hook is used inside PropertiesManager)
    
    
# Uncertainties found:
----------------------
    Data file character encoding:
    -----------------------------
        Instructions says: "The character encoding is 8 bit US ASCII".
        Java charset named as "US-ASCII" is Seven-bit ASCII.
        I chose "UTF-8" because it is a 8 bit charset that preserves the full US-ASCII range (RFC 2279) 

    Purpose of locking methods:
    ---------------------------
        Locking methods using cookies are declared in mandatory interface DBAccess. 
        Their objective is to avoid concurrent modifications of the same record.
        Avoiding modify the same record could be implemented inside the class without making the client to call lock 
        and unlock, simply synchronizing the access to the record, but the problem with this solution would be that 
        sequential modifications of the same record may happen unaware. Optimistic locking could be a solution to that, 
        passing to the update and delete an extra field array with the field values read originally.
          
        My reading of exposing locking methods to higher layers is as follows:
            - Implement dirty read verification at higher level, and only when it would be necessary. (Not imposing the 
                data layer to do it).
                Example: Books must be performed over non booked rooms. So Business.book() method (called after lock()) 
                rereads the record to have a reliable room state knowledge.
            - Have a writing queue based system that can be used at business level as booking granting feature: 
                Example: A CSR tells a customer that a room is available. Then, the customer decides to make the booking
                and when the CSR performs the request an error is raised: the room is not already available.
                
                Exposing lock methods at BLL lets avoid this situation. The CSR locks the record and tells the client 
                that the room is available with plenty guarantee. That is the reason why my business exposes lock 
                methods.
     
    
    ¿2 or 3 tier solution?:
    -----------------------
        Instructions are not clear about the methods that should be callable by the client. 
        
        In favor of 2 tier (Server exposing data layer):
            Statements in instructions:
                2.1) "Network server functionality for the database system "
                2.2) "A client program ... that connects to the database"
                2.3) "when communicating between the GUI and database elements""
                2.4) "server must provide locking functionality as specified in the interface provided ..."
                2.5) Presence of cookies: The cookie only makes sense if the client has to receive it and works with it.
            Other reasons:
                - Server functionality ensured. Data implementing functionality that is not used by the client 
                    application (create record, delete), can be interpreted as other applications expecting this 
                    functionality to be accessible in the server.

        In favor of 3 tier (Server exposing business layer):
            Reasons:   
                - Migration to a web based system is easier.
                - If RMI is chosen, the provided interface can't be the "server" interface since it does not extend 
                    Remote and throws RemoteException in its methods. So it can be interpreted as an evidence that the 
                    previous point 5 is invalid
                - Simplest solution: Orphan locks are not an issue, since lock()->update->()unlock are executed in a 
                single request.

            Decision: I choose the two 2 tier solution, since I think is the one that accomplish the requirements, but 
                in a real application I would go for the 3 tier solution, using the business object (HotelRoom) as data 
                transfer objects in order to optimize network calls. 
	
# Presentation layer, GUI design:
---------------------------------
	The most remarkable features of the designed GUIS are:
	
	- Common behaviour is extracted to a common superclass: BaseGUI
	- Getters with lazy initialization for inner components in order to make the code more maintainable.
	- Use of layout managers in resizable frames.
	- Show readable messages to the user ,not stack traces, etc...
	- Possibility of use the applications only with the keyboard.

	
# GOF Design Patterns Used:
---------------------------

	- Template: 
	       Client: Command class
	       
	- Observer:
	       Server: UnreferencedListener
	       Client: TableBeanListener, CommandListener
	       
	- Command:
	       Client: Command class
	       
	- Mediator:
	       Client: Mediator class
	       
	- Factory:
	       Server: RemoteDBAccessFactory class
	       
	- Proxy:
	       Client: RemoteDataAdapter class (remote proxy)
	       Server: RemoteData class (smart reference)
	       
	- Adapter:
	       Client: RemoteDataAdapter class
	       
	- Singleton:
	       Client: PropertiesManager class
